Project Summary:

1) Loading Data :

        Importing libraries  
        Dataset Loading  
        Dataset Information
  
  
2) Data Wrangling and Exploratory data analysis(EDA) :

       Creating a visualisation for the seasons column.
       Creating a visualisation for the holidays dataframe.
       Analysing for different intensities of snowfall.
       Analysing for different intensities of rainfall.
       Analysing for different humidity percentages.
       Analysing for different temperatures.
       Creating a visualisation for different hours of the day.
       Creating a visualisation for number of bikes rented in different visibility ranges.
  
3) Cleaning Data :


          Handling Null Values      
          Handling Duplicate Values      
          Remove Outlier
  
4) Feature Engineering

5) Pre processing of the data

5) Evaluate model using evaluation metrics like MSE,RMSE,R2 and Adjusted R2.

     Random Forest Regression is the best performing model with an r2 score of 0.6606. Lasso Regression(L1 regularization) is the worst performing model with an r2 score of 0.4264.
